`r5py` is a Python wrapper for the R5 routing analysis engine. It allows users to generate detailed routing analyses or 
calculate travel time matrices using parallel computing, and integrates seamlessly with Python/Geopandas workflows. 
`r5py` is inspired by r5r, a wrapper for R, and is designed to interact with GeoPandas data frames. 
Similar to r5r, r5py represents a simple way to run R5 locally.
