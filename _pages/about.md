Hello, and welcome to my personal website! On these pages, I share primarily work-related content and news. I am currently an Assistant Professor of Geoinformation Technology at the [Department of Built Environment](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-built-environment), Aalto University (Finland). I am also an adjunct professor (a Title of Docent) at the Faculty of Science, University of Helsinki, and an Honorary Research Fellow at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London (UK). 

### Research

At Aalto, I am a member of [Geoinformatics Research group](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-built-environment/geoinformatics), and I lead the GIST Lab that advances research, teaching and open-source scientific software development around a variety of topics, such as:
- GIScience 
- Spatial accessibility and mobility analysis related to sustainable urban development and mobility 
- Understanding human activities in natural and urban environments based on user-generated content, such as social media data
- Sustainable use of water resources and the design of water resources policies
- Cypersecurity around open spatial data

### Software for advancing open science

I am part of the development team of the open source library `r5py` for multimodal spatial network analysis in Python; and I have created `pyrosm`, a small Python package to extract geospatial information from OpenStreetMap dump files. In addition, I have contributed to some of the core Python libraries for geospatial analysis and computation, such as `geopandas` and `osmnx`. 

You can read more about these libraries from [software -section](https://htenkanen.org/software/).

### Teaching

I have authored and maintain a bunch of educational materials targeted for Python users including four openly available online courses and one text book. You can read more about these from [teaching -section.](https://htenkanen.org/teaching/)

### Projects

Me and my colleagues are working on various research and educational projects. You can read more about them from [projects -section](https://htenkanen.org/projects/).

### Contact

In case you are interested in collaborating, or if you would like to work with me and our team, do not hesitate to contact. 
You can contact me via email at `henrikki.tenkanen [at] aalto.fi`. You can also find me on Twitter as `@tenkahen` and on Mastodon as <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@htenkanen">@htenkanen</a>

### Want to work with us? Open positions

At the moment, we do not have any open positions, but they will be listed here once new positions open.
